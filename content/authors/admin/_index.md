In April 2014, I joined Klaus Wehrle's Chair for Communication and Distributed Systems at RWTH Aachen University as a Ph.D. Student and Researcher. I graduated with an M.Sc. in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen University in late 2013. As a member of the Network Architectures group my research interest centers around network protocols, their deployment, and optimization.
